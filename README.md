# Reverse-polarity-protection
Simple P-MOS based low dropout reverse polarity protection

![Schematic](pics/schm.png)  
1. Max input voltage depends on the used P-MOS transitor and the voltage rating of the 10uF cap.
2. Output supply capacitors are optional.
3. If the polyfuse is not used, put a blob of solder on the jumper pads to bypass it.
